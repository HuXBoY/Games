This is where all my "Game" Projects will be.

Some may run in Console/Terminal, Some have GUI.

Python Terminal Games:
- #Scoundrel:
    This is a Card Game you can search about and play yourself with a deck of cards.
    How to Play my Computer/Digital Version:
    First make sure you have python installed on your device.
    Then simply run this command in Cmd/Powershell/Terminal/Whatever:
    ```python
    python -c "import urllib.request as u, subprocess as s; exec(u.urlopen('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HuXBoY/Games/master/Scoundrel/main.py').read())"
    ```
    $- Play tested on windows. -$

More games coming soon . . . I guess!
